I am using centOS 7

Python2.7 was already installed
I did need pip 'yum install python-pip'
pip also needed an upgrade so 'sudo pip install -upgrade pip'

sudo pip install -U nltk
sudo pip install -U numpy

then install nltk data
python
  import ntlk
  nltk.download()
  d
  all (Probably dont need all... this could have been a mistake.)

Now we should be ready to go! :)
